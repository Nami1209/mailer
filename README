# Mass Email Sender Tool

The **Mass Email Sender Tool** is a web application that allows users to send personalized emails to a large number of recipients efficiently. It supports features like email scheduling, personalization tags, email tracking (open rates and click-through rates), and compliance with GDPR and CAN-SPAM regulations.

## Features

- **Personalized Emails**: Use personalization tags (e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`) to customize email content for each recipient.
- **Email Content Formats**: Supports plain text, HTML, and Markdown for email content.
- **Email Scheduling**: Schedule emails to be sent at a specific date and time.
- **Email Tracking**: Track email opens and link clicks using tracking pixels and tracked links.

- **GDPR Compliance**: Includes an opt-out link and requires user consent before sending emails.
- **Data Retention Policy**: Automatically deletes old campaigns and recipient data after a specified retention period.
- **User-Specific Campaigns**: Each user can only view and manage campaigns they created.
